<h3>9 Levels of Scientific Writing</h3>
<p>
    Level 1: Listing
</p>
<p>Example: "Ethanolic plant extracts may kill bacteria, inhibit fungal growth, and deter certain viruses. "</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 2: Definition
</p>
<p>
    Example: "An antimicrobial ethanol plant extract is a solution derived from specific plants using ethanol as a solvent, which exhibit activity because of particular secondary metabolites from the plant."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 3: Chronology
</p>
<p>
    Example: "First, the plant materials are collected and cleaned, then they are soaked in ethanol to extract the compunds, and finally, the ethanol is evaporated to concentrate the antimicrobial substances."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 4: Classification
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts may be categorized based on their activities: antibacterial extracts (from plants like garlic and turmeric), antifungal extracts (from plants like neem and tea tree), and antiviral extracts (from plants like echinacea and licorice). Many of the examples can be classified under more than one description."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 5: Summary
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Overall, ethanol plant extracts can contain potent active substances with the ability to inhibit or kill various microoganisms, offering a promising avenue for natural therapeutic agents."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 6: Comparison or Contrast
</p>
<p>
    Example: "While both ethanol and water can be used to extract antimicrobial compounds from plants, ethanol often results in extracts with a higher potency due to its ability to dissolve both polar and non-polar compounds."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 7: Analysis
</p>
<p>
    Example: "The efficacy of antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts is contingent upon multiple factors, such as the type of plant used, the ethanol concentration during extraction, and the specific microoganisms targeted."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 8: Academic Argument
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Given the rise of antibiotic resistance. It is crucial for researchers to explore alternatives like antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts, which have demonstrated significant antimicrobial properties in numerous studies."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 9: Scientific Argument
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Based on emperical data from multiple independent studies, the use of antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts presents a viable strategy for combating microbial infections. However, rigorous clinical trials are still needed to assess their safety and efficacy on humans."
</p>
