<p>
    Level 1: Listing (Enumerate Basic Facts)
</p>
<p>Example: "Ethanolic plant extracts may kill bacteria, inhibit fungal growth, and deter certain viruses. "</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 2: Definition (Create Concise Explanations)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "An antimicrobial ethanol plant extract is a solution derived from specific plants using ethanol as a solvent, which exhibit activity because of particular secondary metabolites from the plant."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 3: Chronology (Arrange Processes in Order)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "First, the plant materials are collected and cleaned, then they are soaked in ethanol to extract the compunds, and finally, the ethanol is evaporated to concentrate the antimicrobial substances."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 4: Classification (Identify Specific Characteristics & Assign Based on Them)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts may be categorized based on their activities: antibacterial extracts (from plants like garlic and turmeric), antifungal extracts (from plants like neem and tea tree), and antiviral extracts (from plants like echinacea and licorice). Many of the examples can be classified under more than one description."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 5: Summary (Condense All Information)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Overall, ethanol plant extracts can contain potent active substances with the ability to inhibit or kill various microoganisms, offering a promising avenue for natural therapeutic agents."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 6: Comparison or Contrast (Look For Similarities and Differences)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "While both ethanol and water can be used to extract antimicrobial compounds from plants, ethanol often results in extracts with a higher potency due to its ability to dissolve both polar and non-polar compounds."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 7: Analysis (Look For Information That Is Not Obvious)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "The efficacy of antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts is contingent upon multiple factors, such as the type of plant used, the ethanol concentration during extraction, and the specific microoganisms targeted."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 8: Academic Argument (Create a Claim Based On Evidence And Reasoning)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Given the rise of antibiotic resistance. It is crucial for researchers to explore alternatives like antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts, which have demonstrated significant antimicrobial properties in numerous studies."
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Level 9: Scientific Argument (Create Scientifically Accurate Claim Based On Evidence)
</p>
<p>
    Example: "Based on emperical data from multiple independent studies, the use of antimicrobial ethanol plant extracts presents a viable strategy for combating microbial infections. However, rigorous clinical trials are still needed to assess their safety and efficacy on humans."
</p>
